Strassen's Matrix Multiplication# Strassen-s-Matrix-Multiplication

given two square matrices. multiply them using Strassen’s matrix multiplication algorithm.

Input:
The first line contains an integer N, the size of the square matrices.
The next N lines contain N space-separated integers representing the elements of matrix A.
The following N lines contain N space-separated integers representing the elements of matrix B.

Output:

Sample Output:

Enter size of matrix: 2
Enter matrix 1:
1 2
3 4
Enter matrix 2:
5 6
7 8
Resulting matrix:
19 22
